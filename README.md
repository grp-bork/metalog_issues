# Metalog Issues

If you encounter annotation issues in the Metalog database, please use the link provided on the Metalog study pages, as this will generate a link to our internal issue tracking system and will make it easier for us to track the study down. We will try to fix them, but please note that contextual data is often messy, inconsistent, not fully available, or does not adhere to expected formatting.

Please refrain from requesting new datasets, as we have an annotation backlog of hundreds of interesting studies that we would
like to incorporate.

Metalog is being developed by the [Bork Group](https://www.bork.embl.de/) at [EMBL Heidelberg](https://www.embl.org/).
