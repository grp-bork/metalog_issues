# Metalog Issues

If you encounter annotation issues in the Metalog database, please report them here and we will try to fix them. 
Please note that contextual data is often messy, inconsistent, not fully available, or does not adhere to expected formatting. 

Please refrain from requesting new datasets, as we have an annotation backlog of hundreds of interesting studies that we would
like to incorporate.

Metalog is being developed by the [Bork Group](https://www.bork.embl.de/) at [EMBL Heidelberg](https://www.embl.org/).
